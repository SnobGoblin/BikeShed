# BikeShed
Trying out the Oslo Bysykkel API

# Look at a demo. 
There is a short demo here: https://1drv.ms/v/s!Aj080T1LC6z9oSPODwO8EBwdXqoc .

# Run the app.
You can download this zip: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj080T1LC6z9oSJ-tQNqY_djpvbR . Unzip it anywhere on your Mac. Edit the file called ClientKey.txt and put your own client key there. Run the Unix executable and bask in the glory of the BikeShed app.

# Debug the project
If you want to run the project you should first update your Mac os and then install .Net core:  https://www.microsoft.com/net/download . Lastly you should get hold of Visual Studio from here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/ , pull the project, compile and run. The project can be found here: https://github.com/SnobGoblin/BikeShed .
Note: You need to add a file called ClientKey.txt with your client key and put it where the program will run.
